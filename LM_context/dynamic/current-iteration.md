# Current Iteration Context
**Iteration:** 1 - Project Setup & Initial Learning
**Started:** July 24, 2025
**Goal:** Initiate project setup and establish foundational workflows

## Current Hypothesis
"The technical system can be implemented with current tools and environment"

## Experiment Design
- **Experiment 1:** Customize assumption-validator.py and begin hypothesis validation
- **Experiment 2:** Implement basic functionality and test core features
- **Experiment 3:** Debug integration issues and document solutions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Development environment fully configured and tested
- [ ] Basic functionality implemented and working
- [ ] Core integration points validated and documented

## Current Status
- ✅ **Project Setup:** LLM Context Management System deployed
- ⏳ **Learning Phase:** Ready to begin systematic learning
- ⏳ **Validation Framework:** Customization in progress
- ⏳ **Knowledge Base:** Ready to accumulate insights

## Active Experiments

### Experiment 1: Assumption Validation ⏳ PENDING
