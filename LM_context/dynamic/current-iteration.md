# Current Iteration Context
**Iteration:** 1 - Project Setup & Initial Learning
**Started:** July 24, 2025
**Goal:** Initiate project setup and establish foundational workflows

## Current Hypothesis
"The technical system can be implemented with current tools and environment"

## Experiment Design
- **Experiment 1:** Customize assumption-validator.py and begin hypothesis validation
- **Experiment 2:** Implement basic functionality and test core features
- **Experiment 3:** Debug integration issues and document solutions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Development environment fully configured and tested
- [ ] Basic functionality implemented and working
- [ ] Core integration points validated and documented

## Current Status
- ✅ **Project Setup:** LLM Context Management System deployed
- ✅ **Environment Configuration:** Fully customized environment.md for Obsidian Engine
- ✅ **Validation Framework:** Enhanced assumption-validator.py with 26 Obsidian-specific tests
- ⏳ **Knowledge Base:** Ready to accumulate insights
- ⏳ **Working Solutions:** Ready to document functional components

## Active Experiments

### Experiment 1: Assumption Validation ✅ COMPLETED
**Status:** Successfully completed
**Evidence:** 26/26 validation tests passing - all core components verified
**Results:** 
- All JavaScript components present and accounted for
- Templates directory properly structured
- TestSuite comprehensive and available
- Project structure validates completely
**Next:** Document working solutions and test functionality

## Next Actions (Priority Order)
1. **PRIORITY 1:** Customize assumption-validator.py and begin hypothesis validation
2. **PRIORITY 2:** Implement basic functionality and test core features
3. **PRIORITY 3:** Debug integration issues and document solutions

## Definition of Done for Current Iteration
- [ ] Development environment fully configured and tested
- [ ] Basic functionality implemented and working
- [ ] Core integration points validated and documented

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk:** None currently identified
  - **Mitigation:** Monitor as project progresses

## Key Insights Gained
