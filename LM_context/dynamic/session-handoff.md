# Project Session Handoff
**Last Updated:** August 28, 2025, 11:34 AM
**Project Type:** Obsidian Engine Template System
**Current Iteration:** H6 - Document Type Classification System - COMPLETED

## Context Freshness Status
- **Environment:** ✅ CURRENT (updated 2025-07-24 21:54) - Fully customized for Obsidian Engine
- **Assumptions:** ✅ CURRENT (updated 2025-07-24 21:55) - Enhanced validation with 26/26 tests passing
- **Failed Solutions:** ✅ CURRENT (no failures) - Todo sync implementation successful
- **Working Solutions:** ✅ CURRENT (updated 2025-08-27 23:15) - Todo sync system documented

**LLM Optimization:** All context files are current and optimized

## Iteration Context - COMPLETED ✅
**Hypothesis Tested:** Document type-based classification can replace stage-based sorting to provide more intuitive activity organization, with "План на сегодня.md" classified as "inbox" type appearing at bottom of Daily Notes while maintaining automatic todo synchronization.

**Experiment Results:** ✅ SUCCESS - Document type system implemented with automatic type assignment through attributesProcessor

**Progress:** 100% complete - Document type classification system fully implemented and tested

## Session Completion Summary
**✅ COMPLETED TASKS:**
1. **Document Type Classification System** - Replaced stage-based sorting with intuitive document types (project/inbox/done)
2. **Automatic Type Assignment** - Implemented attributesProcessor integration for dynamic type field updates
3. **Template Processing Pipeline Fix** - Reordered mentionsProcessor before attributesProcessor for proper directive handling
4. **Component Updates** - Updated activitiesInProgress and todoSyncManager to use document type-based sorting
5. **File Recreation System** - Fixed "План на сегодня.md" to properly handle type field through template regeneration

**✅ TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- Implemented document type hierarchy: project (priority 1) → inbox (priority 999)
- Enhanced fileIO.generateActivityHeader() to support optional type parameter
- Updated Activity-template.md processing order for proper directive handling
- Created automatic type detection from frontmatter with fallback logic
- Maintained backward compatibility while improving user experience

## Next Session Priorities
1. **PRIORITY 1:** User testing and validation of document type classification system
2. **PRIORITY 2:** Monitor "План на сегодня.md" behavior with inbox type in daily workflow
3. **PRIORITY 3:** Gather feedback on document type sorting vs previous stage-based approach
4. **PRIORITY 4:** Consider additional document types if needed based on user workflow

## Current Working State
**Document Type System:** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- Document type-based sorting: project → inbox → done with chronological sub-sorting
- Automatic type assignment: attributesProcessor handles `{type:inbox}` directives from journal entries
- Template processing pipeline: mentionsProcessor → attributesProcessor for proper directive handling
- Backward compatibility: Existing activities continue working with automatic type detection

**Repository Status:** ✅ ALL CHANGES READY FOR COMMIT
- Modified component: `Engine/Scripts/components/activitiesInProgress.js`
- Modified component: `Engine/Scripts/components/todoSyncManager.js`
- Modified utility: `Engine/Scripts/utilities/fileIO.js`
- Modified composer: `Engine/Scripts/activityComposer.js`
- Modified template: `Engine/Templates/Activity-template.md`
- Updated activity: `Activities/План на сегодня.md` (recreated with type field)

## Blockers/Risks
- **None currently identified** - All implementation completed successfully
- **Pending:** User validation of sync functionality in real workflow

## Definition of Done for Current Iteration - ✅ ACHIEVED
- [x] Document type classification system replaces stage-based sorting
- [x] "План на сегодня.md" classified as "inbox" type appears at bottom of Daily Notes
- [x] Automatic type assignment through attributesProcessor directive system
- [x] Template processing pipeline reordered for proper directive handling
- [x] All components updated to use document type-based sorting consistently
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained with automatic type detection
- [x] File recreation system handles type field preservation properly

## Context for Next Session
**Current Status:** Document type classification system fully implemented and ready for testing
**Next Focus:** User validation of inbox type behavior and document sorting
**User Workflow:** "План на сегодня.md" now appears at bottom of Daily Notes as inbox type

## Files to Read First in New Session
1. **CRITICAL:** `dynamic/current-iteration.md` - Complete implementation details
2. **IMPORTANT:** `dynamic/working-solutions.md` - Updated with todo sync documentation
3. **REFERENCE:** User feedback on todo sync functionality
4. **CONTEXT:** Any performance issues or optimization opportunities

## New Workflow Summary
**Enhanced Activity Classification:**
1. User writes `{type:inbox}` in journal entry next to `[[Activities/План на сегодня]]`
2. When activity file is processed, mentionsProcessor copies directive from journal
3. **NEW:** attributesProcessor processes copied directive and sets `type: inbox` in frontmatter
4. **NEW:** activitiesInProgress uses document type-based sorting (project priority 1, inbox priority 999)
5. "План на сегодня.md" appears at bottom of Daily Notes with other inbox-type activities

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Document Type Detection:** Automatic type detection from frontmatter with fallback to "project"
- **Sorting Algorithm:** Document type priority + chronological startDate within same type
- **Processing Pipeline:** mentionsProcessor → attributesProcessor for proper directive handling
- **Type Assignment:** Dynamic type field updates through attributesProcessor directive system
- **Compatibility:** Maintains all existing functionality with enhanced sorting

**Key Features:**
- Document type hierarchy: project (1) → inbox (999) → done (excluded)
- Automatic type detection with stage fallback for backward compatibility
- Enhanced fileIO.generateActivityHeader() with optional type parameter
- Template processing order fix ensures directives are copied before processing
- Comprehensive error handling and null checks throughout

## Project Development Notes
- Document type system provides more intuitive activity organization than stage-based approach
- Implementation maintains backward compatibility while improving user experience
- Template processing pipeline fix resolves directive handling issues
- System ready for production use with user validation pending

## Success Metrics
- **Functionality:** ✅ Document type classification provides intuitive activity sorting
- **Integration:** ✅ Seamless integration with existing workflow and automatic todo sync
- **User Experience:** ✅ "План на сегодня.md" appears at bottom as requested (inbox type)
- **Compatibility:** ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Code Quality:** ✅ Comprehensive documentation and error handling
