# Project Session Handoff
**Last Updated:** July 24, 2025, 10:27 PM
**Project Type:** Obsidian Engine Template System
**Current Iteration:** H4 - Template System Optimization - COMPLETED

## Context Freshness Status
- **Environment:** ✅ CURRENT (updated 2025-07-24 21:54) - Fully customized for Obsidian Engine
- **Assumptions:** ✅ CURRENT (updated 2025-07-24 21:55) - Enhanced validation with 26/26 tests passing
- **Failed Solutions:** ✅ CURRENT (no failures) - Template issues resolved
- **Working Solutions:** ✅ CURRENT (updated 2025-07-24 22:27) - Template fixes documented

**LLM Optimization:** All context files are current and optimized

## Iteration Context - COMPLETED ✅
**Hypothesis Tested:** Template system can be optimized by converting from DataviewJS-only approach to hybrid Templater+DataviewJS approach, improving file organization and reducing processing overhead.

**Experiment Results:** ✅ SUCCESS - Templates now properly handle file movement and content generation

**Progress:** 100% complete - All template issues resolved and committed

## Session Completion Summary
**✅ COMPLETED TASKS:**
1. **Template File Movement Fixed** - DailyNote template now properly moves non-daily files to Activities folder
2. **Content Generation Implemented** - Moved files get proper frontmatter and DataviewJS blocks
3. **Template Logic Optimized** - Both templates work correctly with Templater plugin
4. **Code Committed & Pushed** - All changes committed to both Templates submodule and main repository

**✅ TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- Fixed `tp.file.move()` with proper existence checking using `app.vault.adapter.exists()`
- Implemented proper frontmatter generation (startDate, stage, responsible)
- Added complete DataviewJS processing blocks matching existing activity files
- Maintained detailed inline logic (user preference over centralized approach)

## Next Session Priorities
1. **PRIORITY 1:** Mobile device testing (user will test on mobile)
2. **PRIORITY 2:** Monitor template performance in daily workflow
3. **PRIORITY 3:** Consider additional template optimizations if needed

## Current Working State
**Template System:** ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- DailyNote template: Handles file routing and content generation
- Activity template: Comprehensive activity lifecycle management
- File movement: Working with proper existence checking
- Content generation: Matches existing activity file structure

**Repository Status:** ✅ ALL CHANGES COMMITTED
- Templates submodule: commit 5701199 pushed
- Main repository: commit 40b402c pushed

## Blockers/Risks
- **None currently identified** - All template issues resolved
- **Pending:** Mobile testing results from user

## Definition of Done for Current Iteration - ✅ ACHIEVED
- [x] Template file movement working correctly
- [x] Moved files have proper frontmatter and DataviewJS blocks  
- [x] Templates work with Templater plugin
- [x] Changes committed and pushed to repository
- [x] Documentation updated

## Context for Next Session
**Current Status:** Template system optimization complete and working
**Next Focus:** Monitor system performance and address any mobile-specific issues
**User Feedback:** "That works. I will check later on mobile device."

## Files to Read First in New Session
1. **CRITICAL:** `dynamic/current-iteration.md` - Check if iteration marked complete
2. **IMPORTANT:** `dynamic/working-solutions.md` - Review template solutions
3. **REFERENCE:** User feedback on mobile testing results
4. **CONTEXT:** Any new issues or optimization opportunities

## Project Development Notes
- Template system successfully converted to hybrid Templater+DataviewJS approach
- File movement and content generation working as expected
- User prefers detailed inline logic over centralized composer approach
- System ready for production use with mobile testing pending
