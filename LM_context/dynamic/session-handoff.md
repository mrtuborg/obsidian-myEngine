# Project Session Handoff
**Last Updated:** July 24, 2025, 11:41 AM
**Project Type:** Technical
**Current Iteration:** 1 - Project Setup & Initial Learning

## Context Freshness Status
- **Environment:** ✅ CURRENT (verified 2025-07-24) - Development environment set up and ready
- **Assumptions:** ⚠️ NEEDS_UPDATE - No hypotheses validated yet, ready to accumulate insights
- **Failed Solutions:** ✅ CURRENT (no failures yet) - New project setup
- **Working Solutions:** ⚠️ NEEDS_UPDATE - No solutions documented yet

**LLM Optimization:** Only read files marked ⚠️ NEEDS_UPDATE to save tokens

## Iteration Context
**Hypothesis Being Tested:** The technical system can be implemented with current tools and environment

**Current Experiment:** Setting up development environment and testing basic functionality

**Progress:** 10% complete - Project setup complete, ready to begin systematic learning

## Immediate Next Actions (Priority Order)
1. **PRIORITY 1:** Customize assumption-validator.py and begin hypothesis validation
2. **PRIORITY 2:** Implement basic functionality and test core features
3. **PRIORITY 3:** Debug any integration issues and document solutions

## Current Working State
**Development Environment:** Fully configured with IDE, build tools, and testing framework
**Project Location:** `/Users/vn/2ndBrain/Engine`
**Key Resources:** Technical documentation, API references, development tools, knowledge base

## Blockers/Risks
- **None currently identified** - New technical project setup

## Definition of Done for Current Iteration
- [ ] Development environment fully configured and tested
- [ ] Basic functionality implemented and working
- [ ] Core integration points validated and documented

## Context for Next Session
**If Iteration 1 Complete:** Move to Iteration 2 - Advanced Technical Implementation  
**If Iteration 1 Continues:** Continue with current technical setup and validation

## Files to Read First in New Session
1. **CRITICAL:** `dynamic/current-iteration.md` - Active iteration status  
2. **IMPORTANT:** `static/environment.md` - Development environment setup  
3. **REFERENCE:** `guides/llm-session-quick-start.md` - Session procedures  
4. **CONTEXT:** `README.md` - Project overview and goals

## Project Development Notes
- Technical project structure created using LLM Context Management System  
- Ready to begin systematic technical development and learning  
- All context management tools configured for technical workflows
