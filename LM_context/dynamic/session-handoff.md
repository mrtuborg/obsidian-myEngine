**Project Type:** Technical
**Current Iteration:** 1 - Project Setup & Initial Learning

## Context Freshness Status
- **Environment:** ✅ CURRENT (updated 2025-07-24 21:54) - Fully customized for Obsidian Engine
- **Assumptions:** ✅ CURRENT (updated 2025-07-24 21:55) - Enhanced validation with 26/26 tests passing
- **Failed Solutions:** ✅ CURRENT (no failures yet) - New project setup
- **Working Solutions:** ✅ CURRENT (updated 2025-07-24 21:56) - Comprehensive documentation complete

**LLM Optimization:** All context files are now current and optimized

## Iteration Context
**Hypothesis Being Tested:** The technical system can be implemented with current tools and environment

**Current Experiment:** Setting up development environment and testing basic functionality

**Progress:** 60% complete - Environment configured, validation enhanced, documentation updated

## Immediate Next Actions (Priority Order)
1. **PRIORITY 1:** Begin functional testing of JavaScript components in Obsidian environment
2. **PRIORITY 2:** Test daily note creation and activity management workflows
3. **PRIORITY 3:** Validate todo rollover and cross-reference functionality

## Current Working State
**Development Environment:** Fully configured with IDE, build tools, and testing framework
**Project Location:** `/Users/vn/2ndBrain/Engine`
**Key Resources:** Technical documentation, API references, development tools, knowledge base

## Blockers/Risks
- **None currently identified** - New technical project setup

## Definition of Done for Current Iteration
- [ ] Development environment fully configured and tested
- [ ] Basic functionality implemented and working
- [ ] Core integration points validated and documented

## Context for Next Session
**If Iteration 1 Complete:** Move to Iteration 2 - Advanced Technical Implementation  
**If Iteration 1 Continues:** Continue with current technical setup and validation
