# LLM Session Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Enhanced Immediate Actions (First 30 seconds)

### 1. Context Health Validation (NEW - CRITICAL)
```
1. VALIDATE: Check if all required context files exist
2. FRESHNESS: Check file timestamps and warn if stale (>7 days)
3. CONSISTENCY: Cross-check information between files for conflicts
4. BACKUP: Note current state before any changes
```

### 2. Read Session Context with Validation
```
1. READ: dynamic/session-handoff.md (immediate context)
2. READ: dynamic/current-iteration.md (active hypothesis)
3. READ: static/environment.md (hardware/software constraints - ESSENTIAL)
4. CHECK: dynamic/failed-solutions/ (MANDATORY before suggesting solutions)
5. REFERENCE: evolving/assumptions-log.md (validation history)
6. ON-DEMAND: static/resources/ (technical documentation when needed)
7. VALIDATE: Confirm understanding of context before proceeding
```

### 2.1. On-Demand Technical Documentation Access
**When to access static/resources/:**
- Hardware troubleshooting requiring specifications
- Performance optimization needing capability details
- Protocol implementation requiring interface specs
- Error diagnosis needing register maps or error codes
- Feature validation requiring capability matrices

**How to use static/resources/:**
1. **Check README first:** `static/resources/README.md` lists available documents
2. **Extract specific sections:** Don't read entire PDFs, focus on relevant chapters
3. **Reference page numbers:** Include specific page/section references in solutions
4. **Update context:** Add key findings to relevant context files

### 3. Generate Context-Specific Questions with Understanding Validation
After reading the context files, ask the human 3-5 specific questions based on what you discovered, then validate your understanding.

**IMPORTANT:** Use `guides/llm-context-question-guide.md` for detailed guidance on generating appropriate questions.

**Quick Question Framework:**
- **Analyze Context:** Identify status indicators, blockers, priorities, and environment changes
- **Generate Specific Questions:** Reference exact details from context files
- **Focus on Decisions:** Ask about actionable choices that affect the current session
- **Be Contextual:** Base questions on what you actually read, not generic templates

**Example Approach:**
1. Read session-handoff.md ‚Üí Ask about specific blockers or priorities mentioned
2. Read current-iteration.md ‚Üí Ask about hypothesis status and next steps
3. Read environment.md ‚Üí Verify current setup and constraints
4. Check failed-solutions/ ‚Üí Avoid suggesting previously failed approaches

### 3. Identify Current Task
- **Current Iteration:** Check session-handoff.md for iteration number and hypothesis
- **Priority Actions:** Check "Immediate Next Actions" section
- **Blockers:** Check for any current blockers or risks

### 4. Verify System State
```bash
# Quick validation check
cd /path/to/your/project/LM_context
python3 dynamic/assumption-validator.py --stability-hours 0.1
```

## üìã Session Workflow

### For Continuing Current Iteration
1. **Check Progress:** Review current-iteration.md status
2. **Run Validation:** Use assumption-validator.py to verify current state
3. **Execute Priority Task:** Focus on highest priority action from session-handoff.md
4. **Update Context:** Update assumptions-log.md with new evidence
5. **Prepare Handoff:** Update session-handoff.md for next session

### For Starting New Iteration
1. **Complete Previous:** Ensure previous iteration is properly closed
2. **Update Backlog:** Mark completed stories in product-backlog.md
3. **Create New Context:** Update current-iteration.md with new hypothesis
4. **Add Validation:** Update assumption-validator.py with new test methods
5. **Set Handoff:** Update session-handoff.md with new iteration context

### For Ending Sessions with Enhanced Verification
**IMPORTANT:** Use `guides/llm-session-closure-guide.md` for detailed guidance on proper session closure.

**Enhanced Closure Framework:**
1. **Pre-Save Validation:** Assess what was completed and validate completeness
2. **Create Backup:** Create timestamped backup of all context files before updates
3. **Update Files with Verification:** Update all context files and verify each update succeeded
4. **Quality Validation:** Check that updated context meets quality standards
5. **Generate Closure Questions:** Ask context-specific questions about next session priorities
6. **Confirm Proper Closure:** Validate that all information was captured and next session is prepared

**File Update Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] session-handoff.md updated with next session priorities
- [ ] current-iteration.md updated with progress and status
- [ ] assumptions-log.md updated with new evidence/validation results
- [ ] working-solutions.md updated with any new working commands
- [ ] failed-solutions/ updated with any failed approaches
- [ ] knowledge-base/ updated with new insights (if applicable)
- [ ] daily log created in archive/daily-logs/

## üîß Essential Commands

### Validation Framework
```bash
# Location: /path/to/your/project/LM_context
cd /path/to/your/project/LM_context

# Quick validation (all current hypotheses)
python3 dynamic/assumption-validator.py

# Extended stability test
python3 dynamic/assumption-validator.py --stability-hours 1

# Full validation test
python3 dynamic/assumption-validator.py --stability-hours 24 --stability-only
```

### Working Solutions (Reference Only)

cd /path/to/your/main/project

# Run project-specific tests (customize for your domain)
./scripts/run_tests.sh

# Basic functionality test (customize for your project)
./scripts/basic_test.sh
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Rules

### CRITICAL: LM_context/ vs Project Knowledge Distinction

**What LM_context/ Contains (Session Management):**
- **Session state and handoffs** - Where you left off, what's next
- **Iteration tracking and progress** - Current goals, success criteria, completion status  
- **Working/failed solution patterns** - What works, what doesn't, why
- **Optimization guides and workflows** - How to work efficiently

**What Lives in Project Root (NOT in LM_context/):**
- **Source code and implementations** - Actual project deliverables
- **Technical documentation** - API docs, architecture guides, tutorials
- **Build systems and scripts** - Working project scripts and configurations
- **Domain expertise** - Complete knowledge bases and reference materials

**LLM Behavior Rules:**
- **DO:** Update LM_context/ files with session progress and solution patterns
- **DON'T:** Put complete tutorials, API documentation, or source code in LM_context/
- **DO:** Reference project files when needed, but keep context focused on session management
- **DON'T:** Duplicate project knowledge in context files - use references instead

**Example - GStreamer Project:**
```
‚úÖ CORRECT in LM_context/: "Working solution: gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src ! tee ! udpsink"
‚ùå WRONG in LM_context/: Complete GStreamer plugin development tutorial

‚úÖ CORRECT in LM_context/: "Failed: RTSP streaming (>200ms latency)"  
‚ùå WRONG in LM_context/: Full RTSP protocol specification

‚úÖ CORRECT in LM_context/: "Next: Test multi-consumer tee performance"
‚ùå WRONG in LM_context/: Complete melexis_v4l2.h API documentation
```

### CRITICAL: guides/ vs knowledge/ Distinction (FOR LLM CONTEXT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT)

**When working on the LLM Context System itself:**

**What goes in guides/ (System Instructions):**
- **Session procedures** - How to start/end sessions
- **Human commands** - Copy-paste commands for humans
- **System setup** - How to recreate the system
- **Troubleshooting** - How to fix system problems
- **Maintenance** - How to maintain the system

**What goes in knowledge/ (Learning Artifacts):**
- **Development insights** - What we learned building the system
- **Technical discoveries** - Architecture insights and design decisions
- **Research findings** - Performance analysis and optimization studies
- **Case studies** - Real project applications and lessons learned
- **Foundational elements** - Core concepts and principles discovered

**üö® CRITICAL VALIDATION PROCESS - ALWAYS ASK BEFORE PLACING FILES:**

**When unsure about file placement, ALWAYS ask the human:**
```
"Is this about session management or learning content?"

If session management ‚Üí LM_context/
If learning content ‚Üí knowledge/
```

**Follow-up Testing Questions:**
1. "Does this teach HOW to do something?" ‚Üí knowledge/
2. "Does this track WHERE we are in work?" ‚Üí LM_context/
3. "Would this help in future sessions to understand progress?" ‚Üí LM_context/
4. "Would this help understand concepts or techniques?" ‚Üí knowledge/

**LLM Behavior Rules for LLM Context System Development:**
- **MANDATORY:** Ask validation question when file placement is unclear
- **DO:** Put development insights in knowledge/foundational-elements/
- **DON'T:** Put development insights in guides/ (that's for instructions)
- **DO:** Put system procedures in guides/ (how to use the system)
- **DON'T:** Put learning outcomes in guides/ (that's for knowledge/)
- **ALWAYS:** Test your decision with the human before proceeding

**Example - LLM Context System Development:**
```
‚úÖ CORRECT in knowledge/: "Discovery: Archive directory is essential for system functionality"
‚ùå WRONG in guides/: "Discovery: Archive directory is essential for system functionality"

‚úÖ CORRECT in guides/: "How to start an LLM session with validation"
‚ùå WRONG in knowledge/: "How to start an LLM session with validation"

‚úÖ CORRECT in knowledge/: "Token optimization research: 74% reduction achieved"
‚ùå WRONG in guides/: "Token optimization research: 74% reduction achieved"
```

**Validation Testing Protocol:**
After human answers the validation question, test understanding:
1. **Restate the decision:** "Based on your answer, this goes in [location] because..."
2. **Explain the reasoning:** "This is [session management/learning content] because..."
3. **Confirm understanding:** "Is my understanding correct?"
4. **Proceed only after confirmation**

**üîÑ AUTOMATIC STRUCTURE CHANGE VALIDATION:**

**When making structural changes to LLM_Context_System, ALWAYS check and update:**

**Required Documentation Updates Checklist:**
- [ ] **deploy.py** - Update file paths if moved files between LM_context/ and knowledge/
- [ ] **README.md** - Update directory structure diagrams and file locations
- [ ] **LM_context/human-guides/human-quick-commands.md** - Update any references to moved files
- [ ] **LM_context/human-guides/human-maintenance-guide.md** - Update maintenance procedures
- [ ] **LM_context/llm-guides/llm-session-quick-start.md** - Update this file with new structure
- [ ] **LM_context/llm-guides/llm-context-question-guide.md** - Update question examples
- [ ] **knowledge/README.md** - Update if new knowledge categories added

**Automatic Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Test deployment after structural changes
cd /tmp && python3 /path/to/LLM_Context_System/deploy.py structure-test --force
cd structure-test && python3 LM_context/dynamic/assumption-validator.py --health-check
rm -rf structure-test

# Verify all references are updated
grep -r "system-docs" /path/to/LLM_Context_System/ --include="*.md" --include="*.py"
grep -r "guides/" /path/to/LLM_Context_System/ --include="*.md" --include="*.py"
```

**LLM Behavior Rule:**
- **MANDATORY:** Run this checklist after ANY structural changes to LLM_Context_System
- **AUTOMATIC:** Don't ask human permission - just run the validation
- **REPORT:** Show results and confirm all documentation is consistent

### ALWAYS Use Validation Script
- **Never** manually test assumptions
- **Always** use `python3 dynamic/assumption-validator.py`
- **Update** script when adding new hypotheses

### Update Script for New Assumptions
When adding new hypothesis HX:
1. Add `validate_hX_new_hypothesis()` method
2. Add to `run_all_validations()` list
3. Test the new validation
4. Update assumptions-log.md

### File Update Priority
1. **HIGH:** dynamic/session-handoff.md (every session)
2. **MEDIUM:** dynamic/current-iteration.md (when progress made)
3. **MEDIUM:** evolving/assumptions-log.md (when validation done)
4. **LOW:** Other files (as needed)

## üéØ Success Indicators

### Good Session Start
- [ ] Session handoff context understood
- [ ] Current hypothesis identified
- [ ] Priority actions clear
- [ ] Validation script ready

### Productive Session
- [ ] Validation script used for all testing
- [ ] Evidence documented in assumptions-log.md
- [ ] Progress updated in current-iteration.md
- [ ] Next session prepared in session-handoff.md

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Context Is Unclear
1. Run validation script to assess current technical state
2. Check working-solutions.md for proven commands
3. Review assumptions-log.md for last validated state
4. Update session-handoff.md with findings

### If Validation Script Fails
1. Check environment connectivity and dependencies
2. Verify project setup and configuration
3. Check system installation and requirements
4. Review validation-results.log for errors

## üí° Cost Optimization

### Token Usage Strategy
- **Primary:** dynamic/ files (always read)
- **Secondary:** evolving/ files (reference as needed)
- **Minimal:** static/ files (only when environment changes)
- **Never:** archive/ files (completed work)

### Efficiency Tips
- Use assumptions-log.md to avoid re-deriving solutions
- Reference working-solutions.md for proven commands
- Use validation script instead of manual testing
- Keep session-handoff.md concise and actionable
