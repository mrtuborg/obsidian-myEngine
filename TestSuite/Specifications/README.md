# TestSuite Specifications

This directory contains comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) specifications for core components in the project. These specifications serve as both documentation and executable test suites that describe component behavior through detailed test cases.

## Available Specifications

### noteBlocksParser TDD Specification
**File**: `noteBlocksParser-TDD-Specification.md`

A comprehensive specification for the core `noteBlocksParser` component that describes its complete behavior through executable tests.

**Coverage includes:**
- **Architecture Validation**: Factory pattern, method presence, component instantiation
- **Block Type Detection**: Headers, todos, done items, callouts, code blocks, mentions
- **Indentation & Hierarchy**: Level calculation, parent-child relationships, header hierarchy
- **Document Parsing**: Complex document structures, multi-block scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: Empty content, malformed markdown, special characters, null inputs
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Small/medium/large document processing with timing thresholds
- **File System Integration**: File loading, batch processing, Obsidian integration
- **Component Contract**: Definitive behavioral requirements and rules

**Key Features:**
- 100+ individual test cases across all functionality areas
- Performance benchmarks with specific timing requirements
- Real-world document parsing scenarios
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Integration testing with Obsidian file system
- Executable DataviewJS test blocks for live validation

## Specification Philosophy

These TDD specifications follow the principle of **"tests as documentation"** where:

1. **Behavior is Defined by Tests**: Each test case explicitly defines expected component behavior
2. **Executable Documentation**: Specifications can be run to validate current implementation
3. **Regression Prevention**: Changes that break existing behavior are immediately detected
4. **Development Guide**: New developers can understand components by reading the tests
5. **Contract Enforcement**: Specifications serve as binding contracts for component behavior

## How to Use Specifications

### Running Tests
1. Open the specification file in Obsidian
2. Execute individual DataviewJS blocks to test specific functionality
3. Run all blocks in sequence for comprehensive validation
4. Monitor console output for detailed test results

### Understanding Components
1. Read the "Component Purpose" section for high-level overview
2. Review "Architecture Specification" for structural understanding
3. Study test cases to understand detailed behavior
4. Check "Component Contract" for definitive requirements

### Maintaining Specifications
1. Update test expectations when component behavior changes
2. Add new test cases for new features or edge cases
3. Monitor performance benchmarks during development
4. Validate hierarchy rules when modifying parsing logic

## Best Practices

### Writing New Specifications
- Start with component purpose and architecture overview
- Cover all public methods and their expected behavior
- Include comprehensive edge case testing
- Add performance benchmarks for critical components
- Document integration points with other systems
- Provide clear success/failure criteria

### Test Organization
- Group related tests into logical sections
- Use descriptive test names and clear expectations
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test boundary conditions and edge cases
- Validate error handling and recovery

### Maintenance
- Keep specifications synchronized with implementation
- Update performance thresholds based on requirements
- Add regression tests for discovered bugs
- Review and update documentation regularly

## Integration with TestSuite

These specifications complement the existing TestSuite structure:

- **Core Tests** (`TestSuite/Core/`): Basic component functionality
- **Integration Tests** (`TestSuite/Integration/`): Component interaction testing
- **Block System Tests** (`TestSuite/BlockSystem/`): Block hierarchy and relationships
- **Specifications** (`TestSuite/Specifications/`): Comprehensive TDD documentation

## Future Specifications

Planned specifications for other core components:
- Block and BlockCollection TDD Specification
- ActivityComposer TDD Specification
- DailyNoteComposer TDD Specification
- FileIO Utilities TDD Specification

**These specifications ensure robust, well-documented, and maintainable code through comprehensive test-driven development practices.**
